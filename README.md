Covid-19 global analysis using power bi desktop
**📊 Project Overview: COVID-19 Global Data Dashboard**
_1. Introduction_
This repository contains the source files and documentation for a comprehensive data visualization project focusing on the global spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The core deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw, daily reported case and death data into actionable insights, allowing for quick analysis of trends, regional performance, and cumulative statistics over time.
_2. Project Goal_
The primary goal of this project is to:
Transform raw, publicly available global COVID-19 data into a clean, analytical format.
Develop a robust, interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring key metrics.
Provide clear visualizations of daily trends, regional comparisons, and country-specific statistics.
_3. Key Features of the Dashboard_
The Power BI dashboard, contained in the Covid19_dashboard.pbix file, includes the following key visualizations and analytical features:
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displaying total global cases, total deaths, and a calculated Case Fatality Rate (CFR).
****Time-Series Analysis:** **Line charts illustrating the daily and cumulative trends of new cases and deaths worldwide and by selected region/country.
**Geographic Distribution:** A map visualization showing the density or volume of cases/deaths across different countries.
**Regional Breakdown:** Bar/Donut charts comparing case and death counts across different WHO regions.
**Interactive Slicers:** Allowing users to filter the entire report by Country, WHO Region, or Date Range for deep-dive analysis.
_4. Data Source_
_5. The project utilizes data sourced from the file:_
COVID-19-global-data.csv: Contains daily reports of new cases and new deaths, alongside cumulative totals, organized by country and WHO region.
Data Fields include: Date_reported, Country, Country_code, WHO_region, New_cases, Cumulative_cases, New_deaths, and Cumulative_deaths.n:
